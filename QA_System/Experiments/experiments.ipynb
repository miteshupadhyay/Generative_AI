Based on some input data, which can be labeled or\\r\\nunlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\\r\\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If\\r\\nthere are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess\\r\\nthe accuracy of the model.\\r\\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the\\r\\ntraining set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the\\r\\nknown example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative\\r\\n“evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a\\r\\nthreshold of accuracy has been met.\\r\\nMachine learning methods\\r\\nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories.\\r\\nSupervised machine learning\\r\\nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use\\r\\nof labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\\r\\nAs input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted\\r\\nappropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the\\r\\nmodel avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a\\r\\nvariety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder\\r\\nfrom your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks,\\r\\nnaïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector\\r\\nmachine (SVM).\\r\\nUnsupervised machine learning\\r\\nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine\\r\\nlearning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters).\\r\\nThese algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for\\r\\nhuman intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in\\r\\ninformation make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies,\\r\\ncustomer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the\\r\\nnumber of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal\\r\\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common\\r\\napproaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural\\r\\nnetworks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\\r\\nSemi-supervised learning\\r\\nSemi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and\\r\\nunsupervised learning.

The\\r\\ndeep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),\\r\\nand it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different\\r\\ncategories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention\\r\\nrequired and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning\\r\\nas \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides\\r\\noutside ibm.com).\\r\\nClassical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to\\r\\nlearn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences\\r\\nbetween data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\\r\\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,\\r\\ncontaining an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\\r\\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the\\r\\noutput of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is\\r\\nactivated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed\\r\\nalong to the next layer of the network by that node.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3801, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.5597096873788464), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='f6c35e9a-08a1-444a-8520-dd9b02c77a63', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\workspace\\\\Generative_AI\\\\QA_System\\\\notebook\\\\..\\\\data\\\\MLDOC.txt', 'file_name': 'MLDOC.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 22273, 'creation_date': '2025-07-31', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-31'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='cccaf578-d7d0-46ca-8bcd-f6a56e73c599', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\workspace\\\\Generative_AI\\\\QA_System\\\\notebook\\\\..\\\\data\\\\MLDOC.txt', 'file_name': 'MLDOC.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 22273, 'creation_date': '2025-07-31', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-31'}, hash='cc12ef498034880c1d49eeef356c08fcf16162c0b034313957b9a5624a3df22c'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d9a747c9-c3b5-41be-ad1e-460ee076f305', node_type='1', metadata={'file_path': 'c:\\\\workspace\\\\Generative_AI\\\\QA_System\\\\notebook\\\\..\\\\data\\\\MLDOC.txt', 'file_name': 'MLDOC.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 22273, 'creation_date': '2025-07-31', 'last_modified_date': '2025-07-31'}, hash='3c298466d6934bae491e84aedc73d746ddda9b03836db38eb174dccecf6061c0')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"For example, IBM has sunset its\\r\\ngeneral purpose facial recognition and analysis products.

When reviewing multiple\\r\\nvendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features =\\r\\na better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI\\r\\nplatform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to\\r\\nbe delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature\\r\\nmight doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.\\r\\nMLOps capabilities. Does the system have:\\r\\na unified interface for ease of management?\\r\\nautomated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code\\r\\nand no-code functionality?\\r\\ndecision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of\\r\\noptimization models?\\r\\nvisual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries\\r\\nand notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?\\r\\nautomated development for beginners to get started quickly and more\\r\\nadvanced data scientists to experiment?\\r\\nsynthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data\\r\\nwhen real-world data is not readily available?\\r\\nGenerative AI capabilities.
